### 🌟 Highlighted Projects

#### 📍 [Indoor Localization with Deep Learning](https://github.com/timbersaw-jugg/Indoor_localization_project)
> An end-to-end MLOps project that refactors a research notebook into a production-ready application. The system uses a pre-trained **Denoising Autoencoder** and a **CNN-LSTM** model in PyTorch to predict indoor coordinates from RSSI signals.
>
> **Key Features:**
> - **Automated Pipeline**: A single `run.py` script handles data processing, K-Fold cross-validation, and training.
> - **Experiment Tracking**: Fully integrated with **MLflow** to track all parameters, metrics, and model artifacts.
> - **Deployment-Ready**: The final ensemble model is packaged into a live API using **BentoML**, containerized with **Docker**, and prepared for deployment on **Kubernetes**.

#### 💬 [One Piece Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/timbersaw-jugg/one_piece_review)
> A complete NLP project that performs sentiment analysis on scraped anime reviews. This demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline: from web scraping with BeautifulSoup to text processing, sentiment scoring with **TextBlob**, and finally, creating insightful data visualizations.
